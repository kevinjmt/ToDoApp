# ✅ ToDoApp
A very simple, clean and quick ToDoApp
___
This project is a MongoDB and Flask App for my CA4 Back-End Course.
Very simple, clean, quick to use it as a personal ToDo App !

The aim of this project is to do an App link to a MongoDB Database. 
This very simple app includes a login and register feature, to link with different accounts. 
Also added many key features really useful for a daily use. Enjoy !
